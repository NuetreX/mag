        <h1 class="event-heading">RC ROBOSOCCER</h1>
        <p class="para">The Department of Mechanical Automobile Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering is thrilled
          to present RC Robosoccer, an exhilarating competition where teams engage in an intense game
          of football, each maneuvering their robots skillfully to vie for the championship. This innovative
          event combines the precision of robotics with the excitement of soccer, bringing together
          engineering prowess and strategic gameplay. Participants showcase their technical acumen as
          they design and control robots, creating a dynamic and competitive environment on the field. RC
          Robosoccer promises not only a thrilling display of technological innovation but also fosters
          teamwork and strategic thinking among the participants. Join us for a riveting experience that
          blends the worlds of robotics and sportsmanship, pushing the boundaries of creativity and
          engineering excellence.
         <h4> Eligibility Criteria</h4>
          ● Participants can be from any UG course.
          <h5>IMMOBILITY CRITERIA:</h5>
          ● A robot will be declared immobile (out) if it cannot exhibit linear motion of at least one
          inch within 10 seconds.
          <br>● If the robot is immobile, the team can take a technical time-out to fix the issue.
          
          <h4>WINNING CRITERIA:</h4>
          ● Fixtures will be created according to the number of teams participating in the event.
          <br>● The ball used for this event is a standard table tennis ball.
          <br>● For any other technical issues, the participants can request a 1-minute timeout during the
          match to solve the problem. Only one timeout can be requested per match per team.
          <br>● The maximum time limit for the soccer robots inside the arena is 6 minutes. This time will
          be maintained on a countdown 'Match Timer,' which starts at the beginning of each
          round/match
          <br>● The team with the most goals wins the game. If there is a tie, a version of a penalty shot will
          take place wherein the robot needs to hit the ball into a select section of the goal post. 
          <h5>Rules of the penalty shot:</h5>
          ○ The ball will be placed at the center of the court.
          <br>○ The robot should choose a starting point anywhere within the opposite half of the court.
          <br>○ The robot must push the ball toward the goal from this starting point.
          <br>○ The robot shouldn’t move backwards in the penalty shot.
          <br>● The event will be conducted on a group/knockout basis depending on the number of
          participants.
          <br>● Subsequently, the first, second and third places will be decided. </p>
          <h4>REGISTRATION FEE: 750/-</h4>
          <h4>Team Size: 4-5 members</h4>

        <h1 class="rules">Rules</h1>
        <p class="para">ROBOT SPECIFIC RULES:
          <br>● The robot must not exceed a weight of 5 kg and dimensions of 15x15x30(cm).
          <br>● The minimum weight of the robot should be 40%-50% of the maximum weight.
          <br>● The size constraint will not include any external control devices or tanks.
          <br>● No external batteries are allowed, and the power supply for the robot must be onboard.
          <br>● Batteries must be sealed, immobilized electrolyte type (gel cell, lithium, NiCad, or dry
          cells). External power sources are not allowed, nor will be provided.
          <br>● The electric voltage limit for anywhere in the machine can be used up to 12V DC for each
          robot at any point in time.
          <br>● The robot must have at least two wheels. Any type of wheel (castor, mecanum, etc.) is
          permitted as long as it doesn't damage the court.
          <br>● Lego kits, readymade kits, and car bases are not permitted.
          <br>● No mechanism that extends from the robot body will be permitted (i.e. any mechanism that
          would push/kick the ball.)
          <br>● Sections holding the ball within the robot's grasp are prohibited. Sections that lift the ball in
          the air are also not permitted.
          <br>● No moving mechanism other than the wheels will be permitted.
          <br>● Robots should be controlled by wireless remotes. No wired control systems will be allowed.
          <br>● Teams that are not ready when called for the match will be considered to have been declared
          a no-show and will receive no points.
          <br>● The robot will be inspected for safety before the event begins. If found unsafe for theparticipants/spectators, it will be declared unfit for competition until the team rectifies the
          safety hazard within the stipulated time by organizers at the time of declaration of unfitness.
          <br>● The time given to rectify safety hazards/issues will vary based on the hazard level or ease
          with which the issue can be rectified.
          <br>● Failure to rectify safety hazards within the stipulated time will lead to
          disqualification/forfeiting of the match.
          <br>● Violation of any of the rules will result in immediate disqualification.
          <br>● Damaging the arena will lead to immediate disqualification.
          <br>● During the competition, a team’s robot cannot hit another team's robot to damage the other
          bot. If the intent was to take the ball but accidentally tip over the other one, the referee will
          decide if it was a foul or not..
          <br>● In all cases, the judge's decision will be final and binding.
          <br>● The organizers reserve the right to change any or all rules as they deem fit. Changes in rules,
          if any, will be highlighted on the website.

          ● Participants in a team need not be from the same college or institution.
          <br>● Every individual/team member participating in the event must carry a valid college
          identity card.
          <br>● The third Prize is given only for 10 or more registrations.
          <br> ● The second prize is given only for 6 or more registrations.
          <br>● Only one prize will be given for 3 to 5 registrations.
          <br>● The event will be canceled if fewer than three teams/individuals participate.</p>
